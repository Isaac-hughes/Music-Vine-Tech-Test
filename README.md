This application has been built to document the skills and abilities of Isaac Hughes!

## To run this application

install deps with npm i

create a .env.local file at the project root and add NEXT_PUBLIC_TYPESENSE_API_KEY="API_KEY_GOES_HERE" to the first line and save

run locally with npm run dev

run tests with npm run test

## Given more time:

- I would've liked to further expand all the unit tests
- Created a dedicated figma design to base my css from
- Added an audio control bar at the bottom of the page to help with audio control

Thank you for your consideration!
